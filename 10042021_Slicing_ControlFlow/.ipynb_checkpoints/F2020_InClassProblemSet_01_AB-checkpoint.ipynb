Fortunately, following the Neural Data Analysis class you took last fall, you are a Python aficionado and are able to borrow a computer form the local library in Sydney. You think you can use Python to brute force enumerate all the permutations of each word rather than trying to come up with the words on your own. A quick Google search helped you find the *permute_str* function below on Stack Overflow. Use this function and a for loop to print all the permutations for each word. \n",
