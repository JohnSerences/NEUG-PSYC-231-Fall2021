    "* FFT is a linear transform of the data from the time domain to the frequency domain. You can move back and forth without losing any information\n",
    "* FFT allows you to understand how much activity (power or amplitude) in different frequency bands is in your data - very useful especially for cyclical data like cortical oscillations or other periodic signals in timeseries data (housing market, weather, whatever)...\n",
    "* Can think about this (a bit loosely) as computing the correlation or dot product between the time domain signal and a series of sinusoids at different frequencies and different phases  \n",
